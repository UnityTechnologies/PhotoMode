      your existing Volume\u2019s Depth of Field or Color Adjustments settings. You
      can update Photo Mode to work with your Volume\u2019s values by following these
      two steps:"

    text: "\u2022 In the Hierarchy, select the PhotoMode_Volumes child object of
      the Photo Mode prefab. Change any conflicting values within its Depth of Field
      or Color Adjustments settings to match what you have in your original Volume.
      Also, make sure the PhotoMode_Volumes priority is set to a higher value than
      your original Volume."

    text: "\u2022 On the main PhotoMode prefab object, update the Min/Max fields
      for the corresponding settings within the Photo Mode script component. The
      value of each slider in Photo Mode defaults to the average between its corresponding
      Min & Max values. Set your Min/Max range to have an average that matches the
      value of the setting in your post-processing Volume. For example, if the value
      you want to use for Post Exposure is 1.5, the Min/Max range for it could be
      -0.5/3.5."

    text: "If you\u2019d like to enable Photo Mode using a different input, UI event,
      or other custom setup, be sure to turn off the Pause Action Activation checkbox
      within the Photo Mode Pauser script component on the main PhotoMode prefab
      object. Once turned off, Photo Mode will no longer open when pressing the default
      \u201CP\u201D key so you can integrate Photo Mode into your preferred setup."
